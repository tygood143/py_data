8,"The market is going to be fucked.

**Hedge funds are tricking stupid retail investors and actually** ***charging*** **retail investors for the right to hold the fund's bags. Paying $2 to lose many more.**

Look at what happened to American Airlines between June 4th and June 12th. The stock opened on June 4th at 16.74 and closed on the 12th at 16.74. All of the price movement happened during early market. From the 4th to the 12th the high and low was 21.67 to 14.07. That's INSANE.

&#x200B;

Here is a timeline of what happened on the 11th to 12th.

1. Wednesday we close at around $17.
2. Thursday morning, 9M shares are dumped to tank AAL in early market trading.
3. Market opens and some(not all) retail panics and dump shares.
4. Hedge fund spends part of the day buying shares as retail users dump them in a panic.
5. Friday morning, someone buys 9M shares to pump the stock up to Wednesday's close of $17.
6. Retail has been trained that when a stock is up big, it's going to close even higher. So, of course they start buying the shit out of AAL.
7. Hedge fund sells all of Thursday's shares at a cool 13% gain (14.75->16.75)

Hedge funds are just flipping shares from 1 day to the next while maintaining cash positions. What a fucking great way to make money.

14,"Around a century ago this type of economy was called a crash and boom economy. Even as far back as the 1870s it was known as this. It led to many horrible recessions and was part of the great depression. Many of the economic laws created during and after the great depression stopped this from happening. Those laws started being rolled back in the early 80s.

Allowing banks to loan out more and selling the debt off grew our national debt to where it is today. We are now a country that lives on debt.

105,"Fair warning: the people looking for bagholders are trying to make you think the upcoming churn will be easy.

It won't be. We're probably talking about a retest of Dow 26,000 to 28,000. We're also looking at a retest of 22,000 to 24,000.

And that's just the short term.

That's the churn BEFORE the second market leg down hits as commercial real estate implodes into a fucking singularity that will try to swallow the whole economy.

That's the churn before COVID wave 1.5 (protests + Memorial Day + campaign rallies) fully materializes in the form of follow-on infections and fat tail effects.

And that wave is the one before COVID wave 2.0 (the actual fall/winter wave) hits.

And I haven't even discussed the fucking tantrum the high-net worth bitches are going to throw when Biden wins the election.

Go back and take a look at the Great Recession. And start in March 2007, the actual start when Lehman was exposed as rotten from top to bottom.

The market actually set new highs, then went into a pretty frothy churn, and finally said ""fuck this"" and crashed. And that still took at least five legs down before the market finally reached the actual rock bottom.

In its heart, the market wants to go to 40,000. In its brain, the market knows 14,000 to 16,000 makes a lot more sense.

In the short run, the market is a voting machine that wants to believe in America. In the long run, it's a weighting machine that will have to count the carnage of a commercial real estate implosion that was coming with or without COVID."

674,"Being real: stock markets are corporate currency. It's the money for corporations and people who have made it. It's why bezos and musk have all their shit tied up. Because money fell off and the people who actually have money have so much it has no meaning. 

Unless you or anyone else on this sub are trust fund babies as I am sure some are; were fucked"
675,It’s like Madden announcing stocks
676,We are all Roostafarians on this blessed day.
677,Stocks are virtually attached to nothing
678,Wait I thought stonks only went up.
679,I'm pretty sure the team that gets the ball to the endzone the most will win usually.
680,"Lies, stocks only go up"
681,It is getting harder to tell what is satire these days and what is a 'legitimate' news story.
682,Lol was watching some premarket YouTube vids this morning and it auto-played some sweet TA from these 16 year olds and they started with Tesla but every stock that is literally what they were saying. “Ya if you look at the charts at close you can clearly see based on these lines I drew that tomorrow we are going to see some big movement either up or down”. These guys are brilliant
683,I feel you absolutely understand
684,"Don't you guys call yourselves autists?

Just saying, I don't think most people give that much of a shit."
685,They probably just hired an Australian analyst.
686,"As long as the finance gurus don't run out of real animals and start using cryptids and fantastical beasts then I am OK with this.

I don't know what a Bigfoot or Wookie market would look like -- and I do not want to find out."
687,"kangaroos are murderous bastards.  They'll straight up retreat to a pond to lure you there, so they can purposefully drown you.  Bear and Bulls?  You kinda expect the death, I mean, c'mon, look at those big ass horns, or giant paws and teeth.  But the cute hoppy kangaroo?  Aww, he's so cute, he's nice... no, he WANTS TO MURDER YOU - just like the stock market.

Theta Gang - Favors credits, i.e. selling options strategies that are THETA POSITIVE and VEGA NEGATIVE. Theta’s ideal market conditions are DECREASING volatility because they can sell options at high prices and then volatility drops and the underlying stays within their profitability range.

If the popular Robinhood stocks are corresponding to ""lower returns"" that begs the question... who is profiting?

Retail is injecting liquidity into the market because they are buying up illiquid assets. Shares of undesirable stocks. Banks can now use that money for other parts of the business, or reinvested into undervalued, liquid assets.

To unload Coty, all banks had to do was buy a ton of it, short squeezing people, and then when COTY moons, unload all of the shares onto retail.

Anyone with half a brain know that Coty is in deep trouble. Fewer face-to-face interactions means less desire for makeup and perfume/cologne. Who the fuck would be dumb enough to invest in Coty nowadays? Unless you're chasing a short squeeze, it's a trash company.

I wish I got a date that was further out. 7/17 is going to start to decay to theta pretty quickly. But I think these will drop soon enough. Perhaps before 4th of July.

> 
> That's the kangaroo market.

A lot of people selling options have stops, which are getting hit and causing them to take losses when the market does huge swings. 

For example, if you sold a bunch of cash-secured puts, the massive drop on Thursday could have wiped you out. Option sellers have to manage risk and set the maximum loss they're willing to take before they close a position. If they just ""let it ride"" they are vulnerable to margin calls and having their broker force sales to close positions.

Plus when we have a big run up like we just had, people get the attitude that selling puts ""is like free money"" and so they rake it in for a while and it becomes a crowded trade, then BAM GET FUCKED all of a sudden, like yesterday."
1151,Theta gang ideally wants to sell puts in a bull market and sell calls in a bear market so they reliably expire worthless. In kangaroo market no one knows if the call will be in the money or not.

1274,"Except in a kangaroo market, it is possible for both theta gang and kangaroo gang to win. Actually it is more likely that theta gang will win as long as they pick good stocks. 

Yeah sure, kangaroo gang buys a far OTM put from theta gang, and it somehow expires ITM, but then theta gang just sells calls from the stock. And then yeah maybe kangaroo gang buys those calls, and maybe they end up ITM, but then theta gang didn't lose. 

Unless a stock just dies or never comes near the original strike again, theta gang still wins in a kangaroo market. 

And yeah sure kangaroo gang could win, but their chances of getting most of the plays right along the way are soo damn small."

I should have made a trendline from last month that ignores this pump n dump rally and then sell puts below it. Selling $10 or $11 puts would probably be safe money. If it's going to drop, $12 is probably the target.

Maybe I can sell calls to pay for my puts."

Its cost benefit analysis. Housing the homeless is proven in a dozen studies to be cheaper per capita than leaving them on the streets and having the fallout of that but housing them has an immediate cost that would be extracted through taxes while ""unaccounted"" homeless costs can be rolled into negative balance sheets. Its also the case that being homeless hostile drives them away from your locality - if you start actually fixing the problem you will have homeless flock to your policy area because you aren't predating the most vulnerable like everyone else. The status quo maintains minimal taxes and minimal social responsibility to maximize profits by externalizing costs on institutions that cannot set their own budgets and tax the rich to balance them.

Why do you think black communities collectively think its hopeless and they have to burn buildings to bring about change? They were always the first to drop out of the economy the moment it became feasible due to culturally normalized racism in every facet of American society. Of course you turn to drugs and gangs when there is no real path to prosperity provided to you otherwise.

You only win at the money game by having absolutely no empathy for anyone else. When your society is structured around rewarding exploitation with gainz expect to be exploited. Why do you think the capital gains tax rate is half the rate of what the average laborer pays in income tax? Because you know who is writing that tax code.

Your average adult American is totally worthless to capitalism. They have a high school diploma and like 2 semesters of college that you could get out of Khan Academy in a month. And they forgot all that anyway because its being drilled into their head like its 1930 and Henry Ford needs them to know how to work a rivet gun. Their skills don't match at all want capital wants - and with wealth centralization, that overwhelmingly becomes ""to make money into more money"". Ultimately the easiest way to do that is to own the money printer, make the cash for yourself, and cut out all the middle men - the labor force, the markets, the goods and services exchange. Get straight to the point. Its market optimization at work."

See: Sprint and Wework.￼ With Sprint, I’m guessing they figured that since they own a carrier in Japan, it wouldn’t be too hard to expand operations to the US, but he didn’t realize just how bad Sprint’s network is, and that they would have to literally give service out for free just to keep subscriber numbers for the merger.￼ The dynamics of running an American cellular carrier are significantly different than a Japanese carrier, there’s a lot more land to cover with a lot less density.￼ ￼For WeWork, he just got straight up swindled.￼"
